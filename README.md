# Vanilla JS app prototype practice area

These are for fun! You know, it's kinda nice to have some experience trying to build these things without a framework first. Luckily we have things like string templates and es modeles now too.

## get it going

1. clone the repo
2. open a terminal
3. navigate to the folder of the repo `cd projets/js-app-prototype` or something
4. `npm install`
5. this project uses Vite as the build-tool and live server
6. `npm run dev` will start the server

To stop the server, type `control + c`

## Branches to explore

-  main (will eventually be cleared out a bit as a starter)
-  lunch-order (small menu, cart, and admin)
-  ?
